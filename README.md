Scales OpenShift worker nodes when 50% of them reach 60% CPU & Memory usage â€” powered by real-time Prometheus metrics and a smart Python agent.
This project uses advanced predictive supervised machine learning approach with linear regression to model temporal trends in cluster resource consumption, facilitating anticipatory autoscaling decisions based on short-term forecasting.
- Prometheus-based node monitoring
- Automated scaling via MachineSet
- Easy to deploy, secure, and extendable
